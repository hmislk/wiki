### Title: Managing Expiring Items in Pharmacy Inventory

To effectively manage expiring items within a pharmacy's inventory, a systematic approach can be applied that utilizes the concept of "lead time" for expiration. This methodology involves defining a specific number of days prior to an item's actual expiry date, during which the item is flagged as nearing expiry. This lead time is customizable for each item based on its shelf life and usage criticality.

#### Explanation and Mechanism

Each product in the pharmacy inventory is associated with a predefined lead time, which dictates how many days before its expiry date it should be considered as nearing expiration. The system checks the current date against this lead time to determine if an item should be flagged as expiring.

Hereâ€™s a detailed example using the concept of lead time for two different items:

**Example:**

**Item 1 - Long Expiry: Zaart 50**

- **Expiry Lead Time:** 90 days
- **Today's Date:** 2024-06-05
- **Date to List Under Expiring (DOE):** 2024-09-05

Given the long expiry lead time, Zaart 50 will be checked as follows:

- **Zaart 50 with Expiry on 2024-07-01** is within the 90-day window. Thus, as of today (2024-06-05), it will be listed as expiring and plans for its return will be initiated.
- **Zaart 50 with Expiry on 2024-07-30** also falls within the 90-day lead time, prompting a similar plan for return.

**Item 2 - Short Expiry: Highland Yoghurt**

- **Expiry Lead Time:** 30 days
- **Today's Date:** 2024-06-05
- **Date to List Under Expiring (DOE):** 2024-07-05

For Highland Yoghurt, the shorter lead time changes its management:

- **Highland Yoghurt with Expiry on 2024-07-01** is within the 30-day window, so it is flagged as expiring, and a return is planned.
- **Highland Yoghurt with Expiry on 2024-07-30** is beyond the 30-day lead time from today's date. Therefore, it is not listed as expiring, and no immediate action is required.

#### Implementation in HIMS

The system can utilize the following pseudo-code to automate the identification of expiring items:

```java
Date today = new Date();
List<Item> expiringItems = new ArrayList<>();

for (Item item : items) {
    Date expiryDate = item.getExpiryDate();
    int leadTime = item.getLeadTime(); // Defined per item

    // Calculate the date when to start flagging the item as expiring
    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
    calendar.setTime(expiryDate);
    calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -leadTime);
    Date startExpiringDate = calendar.getTime();

    if (today.equals(startExpiringDate) || today.after(startExpiringDate)) {
        expiringItems.add(item);
    }
}
```

This mechanism ensures that pharmacy staff are alerted to items that are nearing expiry, allowing them to manage inventory more effectively and reduce waste due to expired products. This is a critical component of inventory management in healthcare settings, where the efficacy of medications can be compromised past their expiration dates.
