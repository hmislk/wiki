Printing Worksheets

Worksheets can be printed to note down the data collected during the analytical phase to be entered to the system, This feature is useful for non-automated tests. The worksheet consists of patient details and details of tests ordered.

Some use a copy of the order bill received along with the sample to write down the details of tests instead of printing worksheets.
