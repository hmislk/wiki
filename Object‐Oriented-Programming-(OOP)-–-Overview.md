**Title:**  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Overview**

**Contents:**  

1. **Introduction**  
   Definition and purpose of OOP.  
   Benefits: Reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance.

2. **Core Concepts**  
   - **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.  
   - **Object**: Instance of a class.  
   - **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts.  
   - **Inheritance**: Reusing code by creating subclasses from a superclass.  
   - **Polymorphism**: Same method behaves differently based on context.  
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity and showing only essential features.

3. **Principles**  
   - DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).  
   - SOLID principles for clean, scalable design.

4. **Advantages of OOP**  
   - Modular code.  
   - Easy debugging and testing.  
   - Improves collaboration in large projects.

5. **Common OOP Languages**  
   Java, C++, Python, C#, PHP.

6. **Simple Example**  
   A basic class with properties and methods (e.g., `Patient` with name, age, and methods to update details).

7. **Use Cases**  
   - Enterprise applications.  
   - Web and mobile applications.  
   - Game development.  

8. **Conclusion**  
   OOP is a fundamental programming approach for building organised, reusable, and scalable software.
