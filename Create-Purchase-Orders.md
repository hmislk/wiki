First, search and select the supplier and payment method. Next, add items to the purchase order. There are a few ways we can add items to the purchase order. 
* 1. Add all supplier items
* 2. Add all supplier items below ROL (Re-Order Level)
* 3. Add a single supplier item
* 4. Add any item

After adding items, you can enter the quantity, free quantity, and the purchase rate. Then the total cost will be calculated automatically. For each item, you can also see the history of sales, available stock, expiry, etc., to make a more educated decision on how much to order. 

After adding items to the PO, you can save the purchase order or finalise the purchase order. When a PO is saved, you can go back and edit the details of the PO, but the PO can not be approved. When a PO is finalised, it can not be edited and is ready to be approved.

When the PO is finalised, we can print the PO request.
