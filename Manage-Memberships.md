You can have any number of Memberships. They may have variations in the generation of discounts at different places of billing according to different criteria. Ideally, the number of memberships are limited to three. For Example, Platinum Membership, Gold Membership or Silver Memberships are some names used in certain healthcare institutions. Some institutions have only one Membership like Family Rewards.

You can add, edit or delete Memberships by navigating to Menu > Membership > Administration > Manage Metadata (Tab) and clicking Memberships button.

_**Please try NOT to delete memberships and the patients with that members will have no membership afterwords. Instead, try to change the name of the existing membership.**_
