Subject: Update on Share Allocation and Investment Repayment

Dear Mr. Anil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to update you on the current status of your investment and shareholding in the company. You have made an initial investment of LKR 4,336,591.54, against a promised investment of LKR 1.2 million to secure 45% shares in the company. It has become evident from recent actions, including unilateral decisions on financial matters such as salary reductions and withdrawals from the company account, that no further investment is forthcoming. This change in investment strategy has necessitated a revision of your shareholding based on actual contributions.

As agreed by the board, the directors will repay your total investment in installments. For each installment, your shareholding will be adjusted accordingly. With the latest repayment of LKR 5,000.00 (invoice attached), the formula for recalculating your shares is as follows:

Original shareholding based on initial investment:
\[ \frac{4,336,591.54}{12,000,000.00} \times 45 = 16.262218275\% \]

Adjusted shareholding post-repayment:
\[ \frac{4,331,591.54}{12,000,000.00} \times 45 = 16.243468275\% \]

Once your shareholding reaches 15%, you are required to transfer all shares exceeding this percentage back to Dr. Buddhika and Mr. Thamara.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We appreciate your cooperation as we continue to make these adjustments.

Best regards,

Dr. M. H. B. Ariyaratne
