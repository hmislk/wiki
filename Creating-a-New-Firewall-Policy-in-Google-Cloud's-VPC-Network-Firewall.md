## Introduction
In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a new firewall policy in Google Cloud's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Network Firewall. Firewall policies allow you to control and manage incoming and outgoing traffic to your virtual network.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Google Cloud account.
- Access to the Google Cloud Console.
- An existing VPC network.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Accessing Google Cloud Console
- Open a web browser and navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Sign in with your Google Cloud account credentials.

### 2. Navigating to VPC Network
- In the Google Cloud Console, locate and select "VPC Network" from the left-hand menu.

### 3. Creating a New Firewall Policy
- Click the "Firewall" tab to view the list of existing firewall rules.
- Click the "Create Firewall Policy" button to start creating a new policy.

### 4. Configuring Firewall Policy Details
- *Name*: Provide a unique name for your firewall policy.
- *Description*: Optionally, add a description to help identify the purpose of the policy.
- *Target Service Accounts*: Select the target service accounts, as All Instances in Network.
- *Direction of traffic*: Choose whether the policy applies to incoming or outgoing traffic.
- *Action on match*: Specify the action to take when a rule in this policy matches traffic (e.g., allow or deny).

### 5. Adding Firewall Rules
- Click the "Add Rule" button to define specific rules within your policy.
- Configure each rule with criteria such as source IP ranges, destination IP ranges, ports(TCP as 5900,5901,5902), and protocols.
- Define the action for each rule (e.g., allow or deny).

### 6. Review and Create
- Review your firewall policy configuration to ensure it matches your requirements.
- Click the "Create" button to create the firewall policy.

### 7. Applying the Policy
- Once the policy is created, you can apply it to specific VPC networks, subnets, or instances as needed.

### 8. Monitoring and Testing
- Monitor the traffic flow and test the firewall policy to ensure it functions as expected.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the firewall policy creation process, consider the following:
- Check your VPC network configuration and ensure that it's properly set up.
- Verify that your firewall rules are correctly defined.

## Best Practices
To optimize your firewall policies and network security, consider these best practices:
- Regularly review and update your firewall policies to reflect changing requirements.
- Implement logging for firewall rules to track and analyze traffic.
- Create separate policies for different segments of your network to maintain clarity.

## Conclusion
Creating a firewall policy in Google Cloud's VPC Network Firewall is essential for securing your virtual network and controlling traffic flow. By following these steps, you can establish effective network security policies.
