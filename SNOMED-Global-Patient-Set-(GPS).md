## SNOMED Global Patient Set (GPS)

The SNOMED Global Patient Set (GPS) is a comprehensive resource developed by SNOMED International to facilitate the sharing of patient health information across different care settings, systems, organizations, and national borders. It is designed to support health information interoperability without the need for a SNOMED International license.

### Key Features of GPS

- **Managed List**: The GPS is a managed list of existing SNOMED CT unique concept identifiers, along with their associated descriptions. This ensures that healthcare providers can use standardized terminology for coding patient information[1][2].

- **Free Access**: The GPS is available at no cost to users, making it accessible to healthcare organizations worldwide. This accessibility supports the global adoption of standardized health information systems[1][2].

- **Interoperability**: By providing a standardized set of codes and descriptions, the GPS enhances interoperability across various healthcare systems. This is crucial for ensuring that patient data can be shared and understood consistently across different platforms and regions[1][2].

### Implementation and Updates

- **Implementation Guide**: SNOMED International provides an Implementation Guide that includes information on downloading the GPS and considerations for its use. This guide is available online to ensure users have access to the latest version[1][2].

- **Regular Updates**: The GPS undergoes regular updates to reflect changes in the underlying SNOMED CT terminology. These updates include concept inactivations and additions, ensuring that the GPS remains current with evolving healthcare needs[1][2].

- **Historical Audit Trail**: From the July 2020 release onwards, SNOMED International has been publishing an RF2 formatted package containing the GPS refset content. This package retains a full historical audit trail of all changes made to the GPS refset[1][2].

### COVID-19 Response

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SNOMED CT has created and added specific concepts to the GPS. These additions ensure that relevant codes are globally available to all implementers, facilitating consistent coding of COVID-19-related health information[1][2].

### Value Set Representation

The GPS is also represented as a FHIR ValueSet resource instance, which includes all codes from the SNOMED International Global Patient Set subset of SNOMED CT. This representation aids implementers by providing a structured format for integrating GPS into healthcare IT systems[3][4][6].
