Here you can select the payment methods for which certain discounts will be available in the pharmacy. First select the discount scheme, and then when you click fill, all the payment methods that have been added to that discount scheme will be listed. To add a new payment method for that discount scheme, fill the necessary fields (Category/Subcategory, Payment Method, Discount) and select Add. To remove a payment method, select delete.
