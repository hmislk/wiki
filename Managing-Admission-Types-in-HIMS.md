Managing Admission Types in HIMS

Our Health Information Management System accommodates a variety of patient admission types to cater to the diverse needs of healthcare service delivery. Understanding these types is crucial for effective patient management and resource allocation.

Admission Types Overview:

Inward Stays: These are the traditional hospital admissions where patients stay overnight or for extended periods in the hospital for treatment and care.

Day Cases: These admissions are for patients who require certain medical procedures or treatments that can be completed within a single day, without the need for an overnight stay.

Home Visits: This category includes admissions for patients who receive medical care and services at their homes, typically through scheduled visits by healthcare professionals.

Characteristics of an Inward Admission Type:

When managing an Inward Stay, the system allows for detailed characterization of each admission, which includes:

Name of the Admission Type: A descriptive title for easy identification of the admission category.
Day Case or Inward Stay: Classification of the admission as either a day case or an extended inpatient stay.
Code for BHT Numbering: A unique code assigned to each admission type, used as a prefix in Bed Head Ticket (BHT) numbering.
Admission Fee: The standard fee associated with this type of admission.
Default Room Allocation: Specifies the default room or ward for this admission type.
Room Allocation Requirement: Indicates whether allocating a room is necessary for this admission type.
Admission Number Count: The system tracks the number of admissions under this category.
