## Overview
Actual Therapeutic Moieties (ATMs) are a critical component of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, contributing to the systematic categorization of drugs based on their actual therapeutic effects. 

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to ATMs:
> * Definition and significance of Actual Therapeutic Moieties in the context of the ATC Classification System.
> * Importance in accurately representing the therapeutic actions of drugs.

2. ATM Structure:
> * Exploration of the hierarchical structure of ATMs within the ATC system.
> * How ATMs align with Anatomical Main Groups, Therapeutic Subgroups, and other levels in the ATC classification.

3. ATMs vs. Virtual Therapeutic Moieties (VTMs):
> * Differentiating between ATMs and VTMs in drug classification.
> * Understanding the distinction between the intended and actual therapeutic effects of drugs.

4. Clinical Relevance:
> * Application of ATMs in clinical practice and decision-making.
> * How healthcare professionals utilize ATMs for precise drug selection and therapy management.

5. Integration in Pharmaceutical Databases:
> * Inclusion of ATMs in pharmaceutical databases for efficient drug information management.
> * Examples illustrating how ATMs enhance data accuracy and retrieval.

6. Contributing to ATMs:
> * Guidelines for contributing to the classification and understanding of ATMs in the ATC system.
> * Best practices for maintaining the relevance and accuracy of ATMs.

## Example
* Amoxicillin (SPMC)
