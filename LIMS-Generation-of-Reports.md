# Generation of Reports
The reports for which samples have been collected and marked as received by the lab are ready to be data entered. 
The automated components of investigations are ordered from the analyser, and results are transmitted back to LIMS. The non-automated components of investigations have to be added manually. 

To enter results into a report, the following path can be used,

> Lab > Report Management

Here we can search all the available orders.

We can search reports using different filters such as,
> * Date Range
> * Department
> *Order No
> * Patient Name
> * Patient Phone
> * Investigation Name
> * Ordered Department
> * BHT

There are also different search options such as,
> * Selected department only
> * List reports to my department
> * List reports to selected department
> * Institution Search(50 max)
> * Institution Search(All)

After identifying the order for which a report needs to be generated, mark sample collection and sample reception as complete. If a worksheets needs to be printed then select print worksheet. TO generate a new report, select New Report.

There will be separate places available to enter data related to that specific report. After entering the data, you can save it, and it will be displayed in a print preview. If there are any calculations to be made, enter the calculate button. After finalising the report, it can be approved. After approval, the report can be printed. Data entered into the report can not be changed after approval is given.
