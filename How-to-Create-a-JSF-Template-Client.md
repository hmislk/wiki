create a JavaServer Faces (JSF) client application that interacts with a JSF server application. To create a JSF client, you typically develop a web application that consumes JSF server-side components and services. Here are the steps to create a JSF client:

* **Set Up Your Development Environment**
Ensure that you have a development environment set up for web application development. This includes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, a Java Development Kit (JDK), and a web server or application server capable of running JSF applications (e.g., Apache Tomcat, WildFly).

* **Create a New JSF Web Application**
  Start by creating a new web application project in your chosen IDE. You can use a Maven or Gradle project to manage dependencies easily.

* **Add JSF Libraries**
  To create a JSF client, you need to include JSF libraries in your project. These libraries typically include the JavaServer Faces API and 
  implementation (e.g., Mojarra or MyFaces). You can add these libraries to your project manually or via build automation tools like Maven or 
  Gradle.

* **Create Web Pages**
  Develop web pages that will serve as the client's interface. These pages should include JSF components that will interact with the JSF server 
  application. You can create pages using Facelets (XHTML) or JSP as the view technology.

* **Create Managed Beans**
  You need to create managed beans (Java classes annotated with @ManagedBean or @Named) to handle the client's interaction with the JSF server 
  application. 

* **Configure Navigation**
  Define navigation rules in your faces-config.xml or use annotations (@FacesConfig) to specify how the client application should navigate 
  between pages or respond to actions.

* **Run Your JSF Client**
  Deploy your JSF client application to your web server or application server. Access the client application via a web browser to interact with 
  the JSF server application.

* **Handle Server Communication**
  In your managed bean methods (e.g., yourServerMethod in the example), implement logic to communicate with the JSF server. You can use various 
  mechanisms like HTTP requests, RESTful services, or SOAP services to interact with the server-side JSF components and services.

This basic setup outlines how to create a JSF client application that interacts with a server-side JSF application. You can extend and customize this structure based on your specific project requirements and the complexity of your JSF application.
