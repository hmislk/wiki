# Introduction to LIMS

LIMS is capable of handling virtually any number of [tests or investigations](https://github.com/hmislk/hmis/wiki/LIMS-Investigations). The configuration can be changed so that all the institutions/departments of the system share the same set of investigations or each department have a separate set of investigations. Each investigation can have properties like category, name, printing name, department, and so on. The total charge for an investigation depends on different [fees related to each investigation](https://github.com/hmislk/hmis/wiki/LIMS-Investigation-Fees). Each investigation can have a [report format](https://github.com/hmislk/hmis/wiki/LIMS-Investigation-Format). The report format is the key point in data managed by the test. It dictates the data captured during the analysis, how to automate, how to generate reference ranges depending on the age and sex and how the hard copy be generated. When the automation is not available, the data entry to results of tests performed on each patient has made it easy by entering [possible values for fields](https://github.com/hmislk/hmis/wiki/LIMS-Investigation-Field-Values) of data capture. The [reference ranges](https://github.com/hmislk/hmis/wiki/LIMS-Reference-Ranges) can be configured initially so that they will be added to the report with the start of the result entering depending on the age and sex.
