# Ward Pharmacy BHT Substitute Functionality

## Overview

The Ward Pharmacy BHT Issue system allows pharmacy staff to substitute requested medications with available alternatives when the original items are out of stock. This guide explains how to use the substitute functionality effectively.

## When to Use Substitutes

Use the substitute functionality when:
- The requested medication is out of stock
- The requested medication has expired
- An equivalent medication within the same therapeutic category (VMP group) with better pricing is available
- A medication with a longer expiry date is preferred

Note: Substitutions are currently restricted to items with the same unit/pack (e.g., Ampâ†’Amp). Pack-to-pack substitutions (e.g., Ampâ†’Ampp) are not supported.
