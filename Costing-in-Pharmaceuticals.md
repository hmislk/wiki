## Costing Scenarios
### Without Costing
Base for costing: Purchase Rate
Stock Value (at Retail Rate or Purchase Rate) ≈ Gross Profit

### With Real Costing
Factors to Consider:

1. Bonus / Free Items:

> Bonus quantity → Cost is reduced → Retail sale value increases → Profit increases

2. Line Discount:

> A discount reduces the cost

> No change in retail sale value → Profit increases

3. Line Tax / Line Expense (available on request):

> Increases cost

> No change in retail sale value → Profit decreases

When adding a line, the following are recorded;
1. Item
2. Qty
3. Fee Qty
4. Purchase Rate
5. Discount Rate

7. Date of Expiry
