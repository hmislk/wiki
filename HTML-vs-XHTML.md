# HTML vs XHTML

This page explains the key differences, use cases, and compatibility considerations between **HTML** and **XHTML**, helping developers choose the appropriate markup language for their web projects.

---

## Overview

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** and **XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)** are both markup languages used to structure web content. XHTML is a stricter, XML-based version of HTML.

## Key Differences

| Feature               | HTML                             | XHTML                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**            | Tolerant of errors               | Strict XML syntax                      |
| **Tag Closure**       | Optional for some tags           | All tags must be closed                |
| **Case Sensitivity**  | Tags and attributes are case-insensitive | Tags and attributes must be lowercase |
| **Attribute Quotation** | Quotes optional               | Quotes required around attribute values |
| **Doctype**           | Typically declared as `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Must declare a valid XHTML DOCTYPE     |
| **Parsing**           | Parsed by HTML parsers           | Parsed by XML parsers                  |
| **Error Handling**    | Browser attempts to fix errors silently | Parsing fails on well-formedness errors |

---

## Compatibility

HTML is more forgiving and widely used across all browsers.

XHTML requires stricter syntax and proper content-type (`application/xhtml+xml`) to be correctly interpreted as XML.

---

## When to Use

Use HTML for most web projects due to its flexibility and broad support.

Use XHTML when integration with XML tools or strict validation is required.

---

## Best Practices

Even when using HTML, follow good practices like closing tags and quoting attributes.

For XHTML, ensure your document is well-formed and served with the correct MIME type.

---

## Conclusion

Choose HTML for simplicity and robustness across environments.

Use XHTML if you need strict XML compliance, especially in XML-heavy applications.
