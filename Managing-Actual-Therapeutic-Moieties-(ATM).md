## Introduction to Actual Therapeutic Moieties (ATM)
Actual Therapeutic Moieties (ATM) in the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system are specific, tangible representations of drugs, directly linked to their conceptual counterparts, the Virtual Therapeutic Moieties (VTM). While VTMs represent the general idea of a medicinal substance, ATMs specify the actual drug product used in clinical practice. Managing ATMs is crucial for accurate prescription and inventory management.

Sample ATMs Related to VTMs:
Panadol (Related to VTM: Paracetamol):
VTM Link: Paracetamol

Decamox (Related to VTM: Amoxicillin):
VTM Link: Amoxicillin

Glycomet (Related to VTM: Metformin):
VTM Link: Metformin

Atorva (Related to VTM: Atorvastatin):
VTM Link: Atorvastatin

## Navigating to ATM Management

To manage ATMs, follow the same navigation as for VTMs, except select the 'ATM' tab or button:
Menu > Administration > Pharmaceutical Management > ATM
Managing ATM Details

## Viewing and Editing ATMs
The ATM management interface displays ATM details, including name, description, and a link to the relevant VTM.
To edit an ATM, modify the details on the right side of the page and click 'Save' to update the information.

## Adding a New ATM
To add a new ATM, click the 'Add' button. This clears the form, allowing you to input the name, description, and select the relevant VTM via an autocomplete function.
After entering the details, click 'Save'. A confirmation message will display, and the new ATM will be added to the list.

## Deleting an ATM
To delete an ATM, select the desired item, and click the 'Delete' button.
A warning message will prompt for confirmation. Upon confirming, the ATM will be permanently removed.
