After selecting the Sample that needs to be collected, we can select the Generate Barcode button to generate a barcode. After barcodes are generated and the sample is collected, we can select the collect button to mark that the sample collection is complete. After samples are collected, we can send them to the lab using the send to lab, and upon receipt at the lab, we can mark the samples as received by selecting the receive button. Time stamps for all of these actions will be recorded. After a sample is received at the lab, we can proceed to generate a report or if there are any issues with the sample, it can be rejected.
