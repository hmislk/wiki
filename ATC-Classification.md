# Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System

## Overview
The ATC Classification System is a hierarchical system for classifying drugs based on their therapeutic use and chemical characteristics. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), it provides a standardized way to categorize medications, facilitating communication and research in the field of pharmacy and medicine.

## Structure
The ATC code consists of seven alphanumeric levels, each representing a different aspect of drug classification:

1. Anatomical Main Group (1st level): Represents the main anatomical or therapeutic group. Example: A for Alimentary Tract and Metabolism.

1. Therapeutic Subgroup (2nd level): Further specifies the therapeutic class. Example: A02 for Drugs for Acid-related Disorders.

1. Pharmacological Subgroup (3rd level): Describes the drug's pharmacological action. Example: A02B for Drugs for Peptic Ulcer and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

1. Chemical Subgroup (4th level): Identifies the chemical structure of the drug. Example: A02BA for H2-receptor antagonists.

1. Chemical Substance (5th level): Specifies the exact substance or compound. Example: A02BA02 for Ranitidine.

1. ATC Level 6: Additional subdivisions for specific formulations or combinations.
1. ATC Level 7: Represents individual drug products.

## Benefits
1. International Standardization : ATC provides a globally recognized standard for classifying drugs, enhancing communication among healthcare professionals, researchers, and regulatory authorities.

1. Research and Analysis : Facilitates systematic data analysis and research on drug utilization, prescribing patterns, and pharmacoeconomic.

1. Clinical Decision Support : Aids healthcare practitioners in selecting appropriate drugs for specific therapeutic categories.

## Usage
1. Database Integration : ATC codes are commonly used in pharmaceutical databases, enabling efficient organization and retrieval of drug information.

1. Medical Coding : Widely employed in medical coding systems, supporting accurate documentation and billing in healthcare settings.
