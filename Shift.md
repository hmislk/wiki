Shift

Shifts are part of rosters
Shift is covered by one more staff member
Usually, one single staff member can cover one shift at a time (except for cover-ups)
Usually, a shift comes after another
There are overlapping shifts in a roster

Example:
Nurses Roster for Ward 10
Shift 7 - 1 (7 am to 1 pm)
Shift 1 - 7 (1 pm to 7pm)
Shift 7 - 7 (7pm to next day 7am)

Example:
Some rosters have overlapping
Minor Staff Roster of Ward 10
Early  Morning Shift 6am - 10:30am
Morning Shift 6am to 1pm
Clinic Staft - 10am 5pm
Afternoon Shift 1pm 7pm
Night 7pm to 6am

These are examples only, depending the situation, there can change.
