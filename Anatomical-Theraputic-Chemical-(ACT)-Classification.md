The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is a widely used standardized classification system for drugs. It was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating with the Center for Drug Statistics Methodology and was first published in 1976. The ATC system is designed to categorize pharmaceutical substances according to their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties.

The ATC system classifies drugs based on three main characteristics:
* **Anatomy**: The organ or system on which the drug acts (e.g., the nervous system, the cardiovascular system)
* **Therapeutics**: The therapeutic effect of the drug (e.g., antibiotics, antidepressants)
* **Chemistry**: The chemical properties of the drug (e.g., steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)

The ATC system has a hierarchical structure with five levels of classification:
> 1. First level: Anatomical main group 
> 2. Second level: Therapeutic subgroup 
> 3. Third level: Pharmacological subgroup
> 4. Fourth level: Chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup
> 5. Fifth level: Chemical substance 

## First level: Anatomical main group

The first level of the ATC code consists of 14 anatomical main groups, which are represented by a single letter:
   - A: Alimentary tract and metabolism
   - B: Blood and blood-forming organs
   - C: Cardiovascular system
   - D: Dermatologicals
   - G: Genito-urinary system and sex hormones
   - H: Systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins
   - J: Anti-infectives for systemic use
   - L: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents
   - M: Musculoskeletal system
   - N: Nervous system
   - P: Antiparasitic products, insecticides, and repellents
   - R: Respiratory system
   - S: Sensory organs
   - V: Various

## Second level: Therapeutic subgroup 

The second level (therapeutic subgroup) is represented by two digits.

> e.g., N02 for analgesics, C01 for cardiac medicines

## Third level: Pharmacological subgroup 

The third level (pharmacological subgroup) by one letter.

> e.g., N02A for opioids, C01A for cardiac glycosides

The second and third levels provide more specific classifications within each anatomical main group.

## Fourth level: Chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup

The fourth level further specifies the substances based on their chemical or pharmacological properties. This level is represented by one letter.

> e.g., N02AA for morphine derivatives, C01AA for digitalis glycosides

## Fifth level: Chemical substance (two digits)

The fifth level represents specific chemical substances within each subgroup and is represented by two digits.

> e.g., N02AA01 for morphine

By combining codes from each level, a specific drug can be identified within the ATC classification system. For example, the code "C10AA" represents "C" for the cardiovascular system, "10" for lipid-modifying agents, and "AA" for "HMG CoA reductase inhibitors," which are commonly known as statins.

The ATC classification system simplifies drug utilization studies, pharmacovigilance, and monitoring across healthcare, pharmaceutical research, and regulatory domains. It provides a standardized method for comparing and analyzing drug usage patterns globally, aiding in understanding trends over time and across different populations. Researchers utilize it to track changes in drug utilization, and assess safety and efficacy, while regulators rely on it for informed decision-making regarding drug approvals and marketing. Healthcare professionals, pharmacists, nurses, and researchers benefit from its use in comparing drugs and conducting more effective studies. Importantly, the ATC system does not recommend specific drugs but enhances understanding and comparison across pharmaceutical agents.
