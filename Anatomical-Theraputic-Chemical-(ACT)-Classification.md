The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is a widely used standardized classification system for drugs. It was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating with the Center for Drug Statistics Methodology and was first published in 1976. The ATC system is designed to categorize pharmaceutical substances according to their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties.

The ATC system classifies drugs based on three main characteristics:
* Anatomy: The organ or system on which the drug acts (e.g., the nervous system, the cardiovascular system)
* Therapeutics: The therapeutic effect of the drug (e.g., antibiotics, antidepressants)
* Chemistry: The chemical properties of the drug (e.g., steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
