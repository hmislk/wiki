## ATC Classification

The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is a widely used international standard for categorizing and classifying pharmaceutical substances. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), it provides a comprehensive and organized way to classify drugs based on their therapeutic and pharmacological properties. Here is a summary of the ATC Classification System.

1. Anatomical Main Groups (First Level)
1. Therapeutic Subgroups (Second Level)
1. Pharmacological Subgroups (Third Level)
1. Chemical Subgroups (Fourth Level)
1. Chemical Substances (Fifth Level)

The lowest level of the classification system identifies individual chemical substances or specific drug compounds.
For example, within the Beta-lactam Antibacterial (J01C), individual substances include amoxicillin (J01CA04) and ampicillin (J01CA01).
The ATC Classification System provides a systematic and hierarchical approach to organizing information about drugs, allowing for easy comparison of drugs within the same therapeutic or pharmacological class. It is widely used in pharmaceutical research, drug utilization studies, and health information systems to enhance communication and understanding among healthcare professionals, researchers, and regulatory authorities globally.
