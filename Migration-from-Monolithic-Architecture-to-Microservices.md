**Migration from Monolithic Architecture to Microservices**

**Article:**  

Our current application is built on a **monolithic architecture**, where all features, modules, and business logic run within a single codebase and deployment. While this structure has supported our operations, it presents limitations in scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment.

To address these challenges, we are planning a gradual transition towards **mini-services** or **microservices** architecture.

### 1. Monolithic Architecture – Current State  
A monolithic application is developed as one unified unit.  
Features:  
- Single codebase.  
- Single deployment.  
- Tight coupling between modules.  

Challenges:  
- Difficult to scale specific modules.  
- Complex maintenance and upgrades.  
- Higher risk of failure affecting the entire system.  

### 2. Mini-Services and Microservices – Future Direction  

**Mini-Services:**  
A modular approach that breaks the monolith into larger, logically grouped services.  
- Suitable when complete microservices are not immediately practical.  
- Reduced interdependencies.  
- Easier transition from monolith.

**Microservices:**  
A full decomposition into independent services focused on specific business functions.  
Features:  
- Each service handles a single responsibility.  
- Independent deployment and scaling.  
- Technology flexibility per service.  

### 3. Benefits of Migration  
- Faster development and deployment.  
- Independent scalability.  
- Improved fault isolation.  
- Easier maintenance and upgrades.  

### 4. Migration Approach  
- Identify loosely coupled modules within the monolith.  
- Design APIs to expose these modules as services.  
- Shift shared components (like authentication and logging) into common services.  
- Migrate module by module, starting with less critical areas.  
- Monitor and adjust performance, security, and inter-service communication.  

### 5. Challenges to Manage  
- Data consistency across services.  
- Increased network communication.  
- Deployment complexity.  
- Monitoring distributed systems.  

### 6. Technologies to Consider  
- REST or gRPC for communication.  
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerisation.  
- API Gateway for request routing and security.  
- Centralised logging and monitoring tools.  

### 7. Conclusion  
Moving from a monolithic application to mini-services or microservices will enhance flexibility, reliability, and performance. However, it requires careful planning, phased migration, and the right technical infrastructure to ensure long-term success.
