Sampling

In automated laboratories, the sampling can be marked through the standalone app for sample collection. In labs not yet automated, sample collection can be marked using the web application. The users involved in sample collection need to have the Sample Collection Privilege which is given by the administrator.

For marking the sample collection using the web interface, use the menu Lab > Sample Collection.

For marking the sample collection using the standalone application, point the barcode reader to the barcode printed in the bill to print stickers with patient details and barcodes that will be used in analyzer interfacing.
