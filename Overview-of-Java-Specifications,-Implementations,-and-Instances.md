**Title:**  
**Overview of Java Specifications, Implementations, and Instances**

**Article:**  

### 1. Specifications  
Java was initially developed by **Sun Microsystems** and later acquired by **Oracle**. The core of Java is defined by formal **Specifications**, which describe the required behaviour of the Java platform, including:  
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** Specification.  
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** Specification.  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** Specification.  

Specifications define how Java should work, ensuring compatibility across different implementations.

### 2. Implementations  
An **Implementation** is a working version of a Java Specification provided by a specific vendor. Examples include:  
- **Sun Microsystems (historical)**  
- **Oracle JDK**  
- **OpenJDK**  
- **AdoptOpenJDK (now Eclipse Temurin)**  

Each implementation provides the necessary tools and libraries to run and develop Java applications, following the official specifications.

### 3. Key Components  
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode on a specific machine.  
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Provides the libraries and environment needed to run Java applications (includes the JVM).  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** A full development kit containing the JRE, compiler (`javac`), and other tools required to develop Java programs.

### 4. Instances  
On a userâ€™s machine, a Java **Instance** consists of:  
- A specific **Version** (e.g., Java 8, Java 11, Java 17).  
- A specific **Implementation** (e.g., Oracle JDK, OpenJDK).  

Each installed instance runs according to its version and the vendor's implementation.

### 5. Java Files and Compilation  
- Java source code is written in **text files** with the `.java` extension.  
- These files are compiled into **bytecode** (`.class` files), which are platform-independent.  
- Multiple bytecode files can be packaged into a **JAR (Java Archive)** file, which is a compressed archive of compiled classes and resources.

### 6. Key Principle: "Write Once, Run Anywhere"  
Java applications are compiled into platform-independent bytecode. The **JVM** interprets this bytecode on any operating system that has a compatible Java implementation, allowing the same compiled code to run without modification across different environments.
