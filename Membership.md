The concept of membership allows giving discounts for any product or service delivered by the institution. 
The membership can be an individual membership or a family membership.
When billing, the discounts are automatically calculated so that the cashier has no need to concentrate on deciding the discount values. The discounts are automatically calculated according to the criteria configured by the management.

All other discount generation methods are overwritten by the membership discount.
