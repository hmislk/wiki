### CareCode Radiology Information System (RIS)

#### Overview
CareCode Radiology Information System (RIS) is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline and optimise imaging-related workflows across multiple departments, including Radiology, Histopathology, and Cardiology. It efficiently manages the entire lifecycle of medical imaging, encompassing patient registration, procedure scheduling, image acquisition, storage, retrieval, and distribution.

The system integrates seamlessly with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to centralize all medical images and videos, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ECGs, echocardiograms, angiograms, and procedural videos. CareCode RIS fosters effective collaboration among radiologists, pathologists, cardiologists, technologists, and other healthcare professionals, ensuring improved workflow efficiency and enhanced patient care.

CareCode RIS is loosely coupled with CareCode HMIS, enabling smooth communication by default. It can be customized to integrate with any other Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) that supports HL7 FHIR and dynamic resource bundles via REST FHIR servers.
